<p>Forked from <a href="https://github.com/RPGer/Recursive-usages">RPGer/Recursive-usages</a> and rewritten to support
building a tree of usages of Java methods. Use it to walk your call trees and understand the impact of your changes.</p>

<h2>Supports</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Standard instance method usages</li>
    <li>Usages as method references</li>
    <li>Static method usages</li>
    <li>Method usages in static initialization blocks</li>
    <li>Method usages in field initializations</li>
    <li>Usages of immediate parents of method</li>
    <li>Usages of immediate children of method</li>
    <li>A history of discovered usage trees</li>
</ul>

<p>Does not yet support usages of methods in declarative contexts, like SpEL and XML. No Lombok support.</p>
